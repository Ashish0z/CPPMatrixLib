# CPPMatrixLib - A Portable Matrix Library in C++
This is a simple matrix library, that is built to have a similar interface for matrices as compared to MATLAB or NumPy.

### Features: 
* lightweight
* dependency-free
* similar functioning to STL
* variety of operators, including matrix-matrix operators and matrix-number operators and a bunch of linear algebra functions

### Updates:  
V1.5 Added QR Decomposition and a few usage examples in [main.cpp](https://github.com/relaxxpls/CPPMatrixLib/blob/main/main.cpp)

### Motivation:
I like Linear Algebra but the scripting nature of MATLAB makes working a pain. Plus it's paid :(  
C++ dosent natively support Linear Algebra, and using heavy packages can make running your code on a different device a pain. What if you could just copy paste a few KBs and get most of MATLABS Linear Algebra functionality?
